Topics include, but not limited to, human relationships, health, study, philosophy, politics, science. A prominent literature on any given topic is used as reference. One may find reading a blog rather productive than watching Youtube videos in a world of great distraction. Author (ex-doomer) aims to provide a series of steps for his fellow brotheren to win this war against one\u0026rsquo;s own depressed/confused mind. This is collection of easy-to-follow how-to-change guides. Materials presented are aimed to provide tool-kit to win through most of life situations. Obtain an indestructible mindset. Author seeks no benefit other than helping people. Author feels. Read this before you proceed.\nThis work is divided roughly into sections:\n Step by step guides on self-transformation. Books/movies/article reviews. Life rules/lessons derived from books/movies/articles etc.  Project Objective\r#\r\rThe end goal of this project is to build better society by helping certain individuals to become better and best, by providing concise action guides and also more detailed info for those who have keen interest. Action guides designed in a way, that a reader, with a least amount of attention can start implementing them immediately. It is recommended, to follow the order in which guides appear.\nDisclaimer\r#\r\rAll images, quotes, book materials that are published on this web-page fall under USA section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for “fair use” for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, education and research.
